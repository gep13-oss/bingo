# bingo

This is a VERY simple single HTML page that can be used to play a game of
Bingo.  The idea is simple...  Every time a ball is called, it can be entered
into the text box, and a new ball will appear with the number in it.  You
can continue adding new numbers, and once you have added 5 balls, it will
start removing the first ball that was added.  It will always show the last
5 balls that were called.

There is a button to clear all the balls that have been called so far.
